## Description

The Classic Grid Layout is a simple and convenient grid in which you can place any widgets and make them custom. This is
a web application written in Vue and based on vue-grid-layout, which provides a grid with the ability to move items.
With it, you can create any widgets, place them in the grid as you like, set custom styling and delete unnecessary ones.
In addition, what could be better than your own content appearance management?

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are shimmed to be a generic Vue component type
by default. In most cases this is fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates.

However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports (for example to get props validation when using
manual `h(...)` calls), you can run `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off` from VSCode command palette.
